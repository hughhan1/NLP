# Symbols in the grammar are case-sensitive.
# 
# This grammar uses a convention that
#    - terminals are lowercase          (president)
#    - preterminals are capitalized     (Noun)
#    - other nonterminals are all-caps  (NP)
# 
# This convention just makes grammars more readable to humans.  Thus:
#
#    - When *you* are writing grammars in questions 3 and 6, you should 
#      follow this convention unless you have a good reason not to.  
#
#    - But your *program* should still work with grammars that don't
#      follow this convention.  So how can your program reliably tell
#      the difference between terminal and nonterminal symbols?  If
#      there is at least one rule for rewriting a symbol, then that
#      symbol is a nonterminal and should be rewritten.

#    NP = noun phrase
#    VP = verb phrase
#    PP = prepositional phrase
#    Det = determiner (sometimes called "article")
#    Prep = preposition

#    V_that = a verb followed by "that"
#    N_clause = noun clause
#    Adv = adverb

# Vocabulary.  Your program can see that "ate" is a terminal
# symbol because there exists no rule for rewriting it.
# Any symbol that can rewrite as a terminal (or a string of 
# terminals, like "chief of staff") is called a "preterminal."  Notice 
# that a preterminal is a special kind of nonterminal.

1   Verb        worked on # In the sentence 'I worked on the homework', if we don't
# add this rule, the parser will think 'worked' as a V_intran and 'on the homework'
# as a PP. Using rule 'VP -> VP PP', the parser could parse this sentence thinking
# it means that I worked while I am on top of the homework, which it is a uncommon
# sentence. By adding this rule, the parser could also think 'worked on' as a Verb
# and 'the homework' as a NP. Using rule 'VP -> Verb NP', the parser could also parse
# this sentence thinking it means that I wrote the homework, which is is much more
# common.
