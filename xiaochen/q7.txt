q7:

I choose (a) snd (b) for this problem.

To solve problem (a), I will use "Det_vo" to represent the determiner that can be and only be used before vowel sound. In fact, there is only one "Det_vo": "an".
After observing the grammar, it can be found that only noun, adjective, and adverb can follow a determiner directly.
Therefore, I will use "Noun_vo", "Adj_vo", and "Adv_vo" to represent nouns, adjectives, and adverbs that begin with vowel sound.
I will use "NOUN" to represent all nouns. NBOTH = Noun + Noun_vo.
I will define "ADJ" in similar way.
New rules that are added in the grammar for (7a) have comments like "# this rule is for (7a)" to indicate that.
The intuition is to divide 


To solve problem (b), I will use the symbols in this chart to represent verbs, sentences, verb phrases, and noun clauses in different tense:

                    Past Tense      Present Tense       3rd-personal Singular Form
Transitive Verb     V_tr_ed         V_tr_ori            V_tr_s                      # "ori" for "original"
Intransitive Verb   V_in_ed         V_in_ori            V_in_s
Sentence            S_pas           S_pre               \
Verb Phrase         VP_pas          VP_pre              VPs_pre
Noun Clause         NC_pas          NC_pre              \                           # "NC_pre" will not appear in this version of grammar.


All the grammar rules before are in past tense. Therefore, I will change these symbols respectively.

A yes-no question is composed by a auxiliary word, a sentence whose verb is in its original form, and a question mark "?". So all I need to do is to add this rule:
"ROOT -> Aux S_ori ?"
and add a series of rules to expand "S_ori".
New rules that are added in the grammar for (7b) have comments like "# this rule is for (7b)" to indicate that.
