3a: Sally ate a sandwich .
This sentence is about proper nouns. The only thing special about them is that a name does not have any determiner. So all the change I need to make is add the following rules:
0.6 NP  Noun_pro
1   Noun_pro    Sally
1   Noun_pro    Xiaochen

3b: Sally and the president wanted and ate a sandwich .
This sentence is about conjunctions ("and" or "or"). A conjunction can bound two noun phrases or two verbs together. I add these rules to make this happen:
0.3 NP  NP Conj Np
0.4 VP  VP Conj VP
1   Conj    and
0.5 Conj    or

3c: the president sighed .
This sentence gives us intransitive verbs. An intransitive verb is not followed by object. These rules can help us about that:
0.7 VP  V_intran
1   V_intran    sighed
1   V_intran    jumped
1   V_intran    flew

3d: the president thought that a sandwich sighed .
These sentences are about noun clauses. First we can observe easily that a noun clause is "that" followed by a sentence. Therefore we have:
1   N_clause    that S
And noun clause can be the object of a sentence in this grammar:
0.2 VP  Verb N_clause

3e: it perplexed the president that a sandwich ate Sally .
This sentence introduces to us a new structure: "it Verb NP N_clause". Therefore, I add this into the grammar:
0.2 S   it Verb NP N_clause

3f: that a sandwich ate Sally perplexed the president .
In this sentence, noun clause can be the subject:
0.2 S   N_clause VP

3g: the very very very perplexed president ate a sandwich .
This sentence has an adverb before an adjective. So I add these into the grammar:
0.5 Adj Adv Adj
1   Adv very
1   Adv really

3h: the president worked on every proposal on the desk .
This sentence tells is that a verb phrase can be followed by a prepositional phrase. So I add this into the grammar:
0.4 VP  VP PP
