\section{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
	The rule 
	\begin{center} \code{NP} $\to$ \code{NP PP} \end{center}
	is responsible for all these long sentences. 
	
To explain why, let's first name the nonterminals that are not preterminals "true-nonterminals" because they do not turn into terminals in one step. Mostly, one preterminal (except ``Noun'') will eventually turn into one word in the final sentence, while a true-nonterminal always turns into more than one words. So generally, true-nonterminals have more potential to generate long sentences.

Looking at all the rules that turn true-nonterminals into other symbols, we can find that only two rules turn a true-nonterminal to more than one true-nonterminals. they are 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item \code{S} $\to$ \code{NP VP},
\item \code{NP} $\to$ \code{NP PP}.
\end{enumerate}
However, rule (i) is the only rule that turns \code{S} into other symbols---there is no other choice when \code{S} in the sentence. Things are different when it comes rule (ii). We actually can turn \code{NP} into \code{Det Noun} by another rule; and if we use rule (ii), \code{NP} becomes \code{NP PP}. Because \code{PP} can only turn into \code{Prep NP}, we have two \code{NP}s now: \code{NP Prep NP}. So it's like an explosion: one \code{NP} gives us two, and two \code{NP}s give us more. All thanks to the rule \code{NP} $\to$ \code{NP PP}.
