# Natural Language Processing
This repository contains a bunch of miscellaneous NLP projects that I've done while taking the 
[Natural Language Processing](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/465/) at Johns Hopkins University.

### Projects
 - [Random Sentence Generator](https://github.com/hughhan1/NLP/tree/master/randsent) using context-free-grammars.
 - [Smoothed Language Modeling](https://github.com/hughhan1/NLP/tree/master/smoothing) to classify text using various methods.
 - [Parsing](https://github.com/hughhan1/NLP/tree/master/parse) sentences into context-free-grammars.

To learn more about any of projects, click on the corresponding link! There is a `README.md` in each subdirectory.
