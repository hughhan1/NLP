# Smoothed Language Modeling

This subdirectory contains implementations of various methods of language probability smoothing.

### What is it?

What is the probabilitiy of a specific sentence occuring? Is a particular sentence more likely to be English or Spanish?

Given a specified smoothing method and lexicons file, `fileprob.py` outputs the probability of any given sentence occuring,
using some training data. 

Given a specified smoothing method and lexicons file, `textcat.py` determines whether a given sentence is more similar to
sentences from set `A` or sentences from set `B`, using two different sets of training data `A` and `B`.
