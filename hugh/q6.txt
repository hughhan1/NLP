The tree of a specific sentence could be ambiguous, depending on the grammar that was used to generate the sentence. If there are multiple possible trees that lead to the same sentence, the parser could guess a different tree than what was actually used when generating the sentence.

In our example, our sentence contained several subtrees first split using the NP-Conj-NP rule, and later on split using the NP-PP rule. However, the parser guessed that the sentence was composed of subtrees that first split using the NP-PP rule, and later on split using the NP-Conj-NP rule.

There are 5 ways to derive the given string from the NP symbol of the original grammar. [Need explanation: use parse -c to generate a tree to show all of the possible options.)

p(president | Noun) = 1/6
p(Verb-NP | VP)     = 1
