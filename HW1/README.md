# Random Sentence Generator

This subdirectory contains an implementation of a random sentence generator using context-free-grammars (CFGs).

### Usage
```
$ randsent.py <filename> <num_sentences>
```
-  `<filename` indicates a CFG text file, which will indicate the rules of the sentences to be generated.
-  `<num_sentences>` indicates the number of random sentences to be generated.
